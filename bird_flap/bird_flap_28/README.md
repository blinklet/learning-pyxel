# Version 27

(done) Change sprite creation so all sprites have a "vertical" component to their velocity so they eventually get to teh walker';s level
(done) add left and right arrow keys to walker inputs



Add walker at bottom of screen
  - Start game with "x" birds and 1 ball
  - if walker hit by bird, walker "catches" bird
    - bird disappears
    - new bird created
    - one more ball added
  - if walker hit by ball, ball rebounds and walker slows down -- making it harder to catch birds
Add score counter with timer and number of hits
