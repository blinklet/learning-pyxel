# Version 31

(done) green bottom as "ground"
  - use rectangles for ground

(done) Move walker up a bit -- either on top or in line with tiles

(rejected) Add clouds that move across screen
  - use column tiles for clouds
  - rejected because it expands the game canvas and so I need to add calculations to ensure sprites remain in view. Out of scope for this project

(done) Change logic for adding sprites. Add sprites every X seconds
- remove the logic that adds sprits back after walker hits them.

(done) Add life count
- game is over when 3 lives lost (add lives to score)?


(done) deleted code that adds sprites with key presses

(done) add start and game over screens
