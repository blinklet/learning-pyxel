Python
------
Add new ball sprite, smaller than birds. Just rattling around and colliding.
  - Have different keys to start new birds and new balls
  - backspace deletes last object created
Add walker at bottom of screen
  - Start game with "x" birds and 1 ball
  - if walker hit by bird, walker "catches" bird
    - bird disappears
    - new bird created
    - one more ball added
  - if walker hit by ball, ball rebounds and walker slows down -- making it harder to catch birds
Add score counter with timer and number of hits
  - When walker catches bird, score goes up
  - Timer resets when walker catches bird
  - Timer counts down and if timer reaches zero before walker catches next bird, then game over
   timer = score. Higher is better
As game goes along, the timer gets shorter
