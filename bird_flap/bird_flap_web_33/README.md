 continuous play score for
  start screen
  game over screen
  game play
  (done) but it seems I have to set the background music when initializing the game. Need to research how to stop and start different background musics


 (done)sound for bird catches
 (done)sound for bomb hits
   need to investigate how running effects on music channels impacts background music. Seems to stop play on that channel after the effect. So I use the empty channel 3 for effects
